# TravellingSalespersonProblem
This project is my own rendition of the Travelling Salesperson Problem that is commonly seen in the world of data analytics. 
This project takes a list of cities, and the distances from each city to each of the other cities, and finds the shortest path, without using 2-opt, and returns 
the optimal starting city and optimal path that should be taken for the cities listed. My hope is for this project to aid in the choosing of the shortest path
for those wishing to travel amongst a list of cities. 
If someone were to use the algorithms listed in the tsp.py file, all they would need is the data for the distance between a set of cities. With this data the file
will be able to tell them the optimal starting city, as well as which cities to visit in order to achieve the shortest path, as well as returning the total miles.
